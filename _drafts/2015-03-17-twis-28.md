This week, we merged _ pull requests


###Notable additions

- [html5ever][] celebrated its first birthday! Keegan published a [project
  update][] with some plans for the future.

- Keegan pushed a [rebased, remixed version][pr114] of Clark's [zero-copy
  html5ever patch][pr60]. With this PR, html5ever can locate tags and
  attributes in an input stream at 80 MB/s while keeping whole-process memory
  consumption to a few MB. Design work is [already
  underway](https://github.com/kmcallister/tendril) for the next iteration of
  the zero-copy string type.

- Chris Paris landed `innerHTML` [getter](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5029)
  and [setter](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4888) implementations that use
  html5ever.
